The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Suggestions on how to run the event

- The game can go quickly if you rush it. It's a lot more fun if you take some time to consider each prize, maybe even opening them up in another tab and trying to have some fun discussing the details. Try to play up the strategy and uncertainty, etc. Don't rush it!

- Spend a minute before starting the game to remove any names of folks who're not in the meeting. You can get it close by matching the RSVPs, but there will be changes day-of. Also, have roughly the same number of gifts as attendees. When there are way more gifts, the tendency will be to avoid stealing, and stealing is a big part of the fun!

- Have some music playing in the background. Don't rush to start the game. Let people slowly drop in. Use the time at the beginning to chat and have some fun. Have some pre-canned prompts to discuss if that helps. Once you feel the meeting is fully attended, quickly reconfigure the game accordingly (as mentioned above).

- When the game ends, take some time to reveal each of the prizes that weren't chosen (assuming you left a few extra prizes in the game board).

- Advise folks up front of the special cards: oracle and joker. It might make it more exciting. OR maybe don't, b/c you want to incentivize stealing and these cards do the opposite. /shrug

- Let people know up front that they will actually receive these prizes. It wasn't obvious to all that that would be the case.

- Take a screenshot of the game board at the end and post it into chat. It's nice to have that follow-up. Also, be sure to thank everyone for participating.
